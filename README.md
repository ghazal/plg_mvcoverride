Hi everyone,

thank you for your interest for this plugin.

Unfortunately, I am running out of time these days, so I won't update it.

If anyone has a solution to make it better, please feel free to fork it.

Maybe, I'll come back in a few months, but right now I have a big project that will take all my energies.
